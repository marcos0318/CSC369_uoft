DISCUSSION:
No starvation happens.
Because there is only two threads for each consumer/producer problem (Each lane 
only has 2 threads, one for arrive and one for cross). Each function also is properly
scheduled and signales the other to indicate their turn under the right conditions. This
means with our monitor, for each lane can alternate preference between the consumer and producer.
We would not run into situations where there is always a waiting producer/consumer (there is only one each).
